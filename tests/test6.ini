# /opt/sentinal/tests/test6.ini

# example INI file that replaces a cron-based logrotate job
# template: file to watch
# postcmd:  run when test6.log reaches 5MB in size
# pcrestr:  remove oldest test6.log.* files when free space goes below 20%
# loglimit: must be greater than zero
# expire:   for this test, keep the logs for just 10 minutes

# NB:
# logrotate options in test6.conf may take precedence
# processes can write a lot of data within the thread's scan rate -- all
# we can do is run postcmd when we notice loglimit is reached
# the logrotate option copytruncate can cause data loss

# example INI changes to use a combination of size-based and cron-based
# log rotation.  this will rotate test6.log when it reaches 10GiB in size
# or at the top of the hour, whichever comes first.
#
# loglimit = 10G
# 00 * * * * kill -HUP $(cat /run/test6.pid)
