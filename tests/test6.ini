# /opt/sentinal/tests/test6.ini

# example INI file that replaces a cron-based logrotate job
# template: file to watch
# postcmd:  run when test6.log reaches 10MB in size
# pcrestr:  remove oldest test6.log.* files when free space goes below 20%
# expire:   for this test, keep the logs for just 10 minutes

# NB:
# logrotate options in test6.conf may take precedence
# processes can write a lot of data within the thread's scan rate
# all we can do is run postcmd when we notice loglimit is reached
