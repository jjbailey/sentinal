Running the Tests

Most of the INI files refer to a sentinal user and group, but the Makefile
does not create either, the reason being the project does not require a
dedicated user or group. Create a sentinal user and group to run the tests,
or change the IDs to an existing user and group.


To run the tests in the default install, for example test4.sh in /opt/sentinal/tests:

# chown -R sentinal:sentinal /opt/sentinal/tests

In one window:

# /opt/sentinal/bin/sentinal -f /opt/sentinal/tests/test4.ini

In another window:

# bash /opt/sentinal/tests/test4.sh
